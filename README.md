# ksv

`ksv` is a web server written in Rust that is still being worked on.

And it's not [that one from the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).

I'm implementing it from scratch (with as few extra crates as possible) in order to
learn more about web servers :)

## TODO

- [x] accepting TCP connections
- [x] responding to them (with anything)
- [x] responding to them with configurable HTTP responses
- [x] proper logging
- [ ] handling single static files
- [ ] redirects
- [ ] handling multiple static files (MIME type detection)
- [ ] rewrites

### Extra stuff that would be nice

- [ ] Caching
- [ ] PHP support (via FastCGI)

## Support

If you like the project or you've learned something from it,
please consider supporting me, so that I can develop my skills even further :)
