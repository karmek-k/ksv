# ksv

`ksv` is a web server written in Rust.

I am implementing it from scratch in order to
learn more about web servers.

## TODO

- [x] accepting TCP connections
- [x] responding to them
- [x] responding to them with configurable HTTP responses
- [x] logging
- [ ] handling single static files
- [ ] redirects
- [ ] handling multiple static files (MIME type detection)
- [ ] rewrites

### Extra goals

- [ ] Caching
- [ ] PHP support (via FastCGI)

## Development branches

- `master`
- `dev`
- feature branches (merged to `dev`)
